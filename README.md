This is a Work In Progress!  There are no warranties or Guarantees of any type that this code is usable for anything.  But I hope it isâ€¦

I thought it might be fun to design a board that uses a Teensy 3.1 or 3.2
that is sold by PJRC to emulate an Arbotix Pro board that is sold by
Trossen Robotics:  You can find out more about these boards up at: http://www.trossenrobotics.com/arbotix-pro

The Arbotix Pro board design and firmware can be found up at: https://github.com/Interbotix/ArbotixPro/

I have my WIP board design up in my Teensy breakout board project: https://github.com/KurtE/Teensy3.1-Breakout-Boards

You can find out more information about the Teensy processor up at: http://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy32.html

Also you can find out more information about this project up on the Trossen Robotics Forum: http://forums.trossenrobotics.com/showthread.php?7644-YATB-Yet-Another-Teensy-Board-D


Again this is only being done for my own amusement so again use at your own risk!  And again there are no promises made here!
